# <p align="center">Circle Equation Solving Calculator</p>

## Description :-

A web-based Circle-Equation-Solving-Calculator where the user enters the coefficients D, E and F from the general circle equation x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Output:
    1.Displays the center and radius of the circle from the provided equation.
    2.If the radius squared is negative, it shows an error message indicating the equation is invalid for a real circle.

## Calculation

Once the values of D, E and F from the general equation of a cicle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0 are assigned,
Radius is computed using:- 
    radius = √(h² + k² - F)
Centre(h,k) is computed using:-
    h = -D/2
    k = -E/2
